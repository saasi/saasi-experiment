## Project Structure
### microservices
These are the actual "load" (负载).

- saasi: web interface
- BusinessService: business microservice
- cpu,io,memory microservice: api microservice

## controllers
These are the supporting services, serving the role of an orchestrator.

- DM: distributed monitor interface
- monitor: monitoring and scaling program

## script_agent

This is where all the "scale-out" script live. A go program `script_agent`, running on the host, receives HTTP requests from Monitor and DM, and executes shell scripts on their behalf. 

## Run with Docker

There are two `docker-compose.yml` files. One for all the controllers, and one for all the microservices.

The `script_agent` must be started before the controllers.

To build and start all of them, just use:

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Data

All data generated by DM and Monitor is in the `controllers/data` folder.
